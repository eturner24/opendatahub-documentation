= Storing data with data science pipelines

[role="_abstract"]
When you run a data science pipeline, {productname-short} stores the pipeline YAML configuration file and resulting pipeline run artifacts in the `root` directory of your storage bucket. The directories that contain pipeline run artifacts can differ depending on where you executed the pipeline run from. See the following table for further information:

.Pipeline configuration file and artifacts storage locations
[cols="3]
|===
| Pipeline run source | Pipeline storage directory | Run artifacts storage directory

| {productname-short} dashboard
| `/pipelines/<pipeline_version_id>` 

Example: `/pipelines/1d01c4eb-d2ab-4916-9935-a73a5580f1fb`
| `/<pipeline_name>/<pipeline run_id>` 

Example: `iris-training-pipeline/2g48k8pw-a8ib-4884-9145-h41j7599h3ds`

| JupyterLab Elyra extension
| `/pipelines/<pipeline_version_id>`
| `/<pipeline_name_timestamp>` 

Example: `/hello-generic-world-0523161704`

With the JupyterLab Elyra extension, you can also set an link:https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/pipelines.html#generic-node-properties[object storage path prefix]. 

Example: `/iris-project/hello-generic-world-0523161704`
