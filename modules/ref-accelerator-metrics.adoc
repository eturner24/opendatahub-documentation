[role='_abstract']
You can track metrics on your accelerators to ensure the health of the hardware.

GPU utilization::
Tracks the percentage of time the GPU is actively processing tasks, indicating GPU workload levels.
+
**Query**
[source,bash]
----
DCGM_FI_DEV_GPU_UTIL{instance=~"$instance", gpu=~"$gpu"}
----

GPU memory utilization::
Compares memory usage against free memory, which is critical for identifying memory bottlenecks in GPU-heavy workloads.
+
**Query**
[source,bash]
----
DCGM_FI_DEV_POWER_USAGE{instance=~"$instance", gpu=~"$gpu"}
----
+
**Sum**
[source,bash]
----
sum(DCGM_FI_DEV_POWER_USAGE{instance=~"$instance", gpu=~"$gpu"})
----

GPU temperature::
Ensures the GPU operates within safe thermal limits to prevent hardware degradation.
+
**Query**
[source,bash]
----
DCGM_FI_DEV_GPU_TEMP{instance=~"$instance", gpu=~"$gpu"}
----
+
**Avg**
[source,bash]
----
avg(DCGM_FI_DEV_GPU_TEMP{instance=~"$instance", gpu=~"$gpu"})
----

GPU throttling::
GPU throttling happens when the GPU automatically reduces the clock to avoid damage from overheating. 

You can access the following metrics to identify GPU throttling:
+
* **GPU temperature**: Monitor the GPU temperature. Throttling often occurs when the GPU reaches a certain temperature, for example, 85-90Â°C.
* **SM clock speed**: Monitor the core clock speed. A significant drop in the clock speed while the GPU is under load indicates throttling.
