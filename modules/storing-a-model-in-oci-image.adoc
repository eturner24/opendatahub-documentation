= Storing a model in an OCI image

[role='_abstract']

You can store a model in an OCI image. The following procedure uses the example of storing a MobileNet v2-7 model in ONNX format.

.Prerequisites
* You have a model in the ONNX format. The example in this procedure uses the link:https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/main/validated/vision/classification/mobilenet/model/mobilenetv2-7.onnx[MobileNet v2-7 model].
* You have installed the Podman tool.

.Procedure
. From your local machine, create a temporary directory for storing both the model and the support files that you need to create the OCI image:
+
[source]
----
cd $(mktemp -d)
----
+
. Create a `models` folder inside the temporary directory:
+
[source]
----
mkdir -p models/1
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The subdirectory `1` is used because OpenVINO requires numbered subdirectories for model versioning. If you are not using OpenVINO, you do not need to create the `1` subdirectory to use OCI container images.
====
. Download the model and support files:
+
[source]
----
DOWNLOAD_URL=https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/main/validated/vision/classification/mobilenet/model/mobilenetv2-7.onnx
curl -L $DOWNLOAD_URL -O --output-dir models/1/
----
. Create a Docker file named `Containerfile` with the following contents:
+
[source]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-micro:latest
COPY --chown=0:0 models /models
RUN chmod -R a=rX /models

# nobody user
USER 65534 
----
+
[NOTE]
====
* In this example, `ubi9-micro` is used as a base container image. You cannot use empty images that do not provide a shell, such as `scratch`, because KServe uses the shell to ensure the model files are accessible to the model server. 
* Ownership of the copied model files and read permissions are granted to the `root` group. OpenShift runs containers with a random user ID and the `root` group ID. Changing ownership of the group ensures that the model server can access them.
====
+
. Use the `tree` command to confirm that the models follow the directory structure:
+
[source]
----
tree
----
+
The `tree` command should return a directory structure similar to the following example:
[source]
----
.
├── Containerfile
└── models
    └── 1
        └── mobilenetv2-7.onnx
----
+
. Use `podman build` commands to create the OCI container image and upload it to a registry. The following commands use Quay as the registry.
+
[NOTE]
====
If your repository is private, ensure you are authenticated to the registry before uploading your container image.
====
+
[source]
----
podman build --format=oci -t quay.io/<user_name>/<repository_name>:<tag_name> .
podman push quay.io/<user_name>/<repository_name>:<tag_name>
